# ClockProblem

Your must write a program, in Python, which reads in a file.  This file will have a number of digital clock times, one per line,
which should be of the form: "hour:minute" for any valid digital time, civilian or military.  For each time your program should:

      * If the time is an invalid time, print "ERROR"
      * If the time is a valid time, build an abstract representation of a clock with a minute hand and an hour hand and print the smallest angle between these two hands for the time in question.
